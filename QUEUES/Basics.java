     * Queue is a data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
     * Elements are added to the back/rear of the queue and removed from the front.
     * ex : Queue of people waiting in line.
     * The first person to enter the queue is the first one to be served.
     * 
     * operations in queue : 
     * 1. Enqueue : Add an element to the back of the queue using rear pointer. , time complexity O(1)
     * 2. Dequeue : Remove an element from the front of the queue using front pointer. , time complexity O(1)
     * 3. Peek : Get the element at the front of the queue without removing it. , time complexity O(1)
     * 4. isEmpty : Check if the queue is empty. , time complexity O(1)
     * 5. Size : Get the number of elements in the queue. , time complexity O(1)
     * 6. Clear : Remove all elements from the queue. , time complexity O(n)
     * 7. Search : Check if an element is present in the queue. , time complexity O(n)
     * 8. Display : Display the elements in the queue. , time complexity O(n)
     * 
     * Queue can be implemented using arrays , linked lists and stacks.
