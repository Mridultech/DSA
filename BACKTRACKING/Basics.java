         * Backtracking: Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that involves
         * exploring all possible solutions to a problem by incrementally building candidates
         * and abandoning a candidate ("backtracking") as soon as it is determined that the
         * candidate cannot lead to a valid solution.
         *
         * Example: Solving a maze, N-Queens problem, or Sudoku.
         * 
         * Backtracking is a form of recursion. But it involves choosing only option out of any
         * possibilities. We begin by choosing an option and backtrack from it, if we reach a state.
         * 
         * Types of Backtracking : 
         * 1. Decison : In this type, we make a decision at each step and backtrack if we reach a state.
         * 2. Optimization : In this type, we try to find the best solution out of many possible solutions.
         * 3. Enumeration : In this type, we try to find all possible solutions.
         * 
         * jab recursion se ham wopis aate hai uss step ko backtracking kehte hai.
         * 
         * Hint : Most question in which we have to use choices then that questions is solved maximum by backtracking.
