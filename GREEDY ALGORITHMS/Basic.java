     * Greedy algorithms is the method of solving problems by making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
     * simply we have to take greedy choices at every step.
     * local solution : subset of the problem which is optimal.
     * global solution : collective final solution which is optimal.
     * 
     * generally used for optimization problems.
     * mostly sorting is used in greedy algorithms.
     * no fixed rules for greedy algorithms.
     * 
     * pros : easy to implement, fast, simple.
     * cons : not always optimal,a lot of time not always correct.
