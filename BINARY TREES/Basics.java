     * Binary tree : Trees in which at max 2 nodes are there.
     * 
     * Level in a tree : Each level represents a generation of nodes.
     * depth in a tree : Depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.
     * height of a tree : Height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the leaf node.
     * height of tree can be calculated in terms of nodes and edges. 
     * 
     * in terms of nodes : root se deepest leaf node tak.

     * subtree : A tree that is part of a larger tree.
     * subtree of a node : A tree that is part of a larger tree and is rooted at the node.
     * binary tree properties : A binary tree has properties such as depth, height, and balance.
     * 
     * ancestor node : A node that is a parent of another node.
     * descendant node : A node that is a child of another node.
