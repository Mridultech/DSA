     * What is Time Complexity: Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the input size.
     * What is Space Complexity: Space complexity refers to the amount of space an algorithm takes to complete based on the input size.
     * 
     * Time Complexity representations by asymptoic notations:
     * 
     * 1. Big O Notation: It represents the upper bound of the algorithm. It is used to represent the worst case scenario.
     * yeh batata hai ki algorithm ki time complexity worst case me kitni ho sakti hai.
     * most important notation for placement.
     * 
     * 2. Big Omega Notation: It represents the lower bound of the algorithm. It is used to represent the best case scenario.
     * yeh batata hai ki algorithm ki time complexity best case me kitni ho sakti hai.
     * 
     * 3. Big Theta Notation: It represents the average bound of the algorithm. It is used to represent the average case scenario.
     * yeh batata hai ki algorithm ki time complexity average case me kitni ho sakti hai.
